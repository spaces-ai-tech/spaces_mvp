# AI Interior Design Agent

An AI-powered interior design agent that helps users upgrade their living spaces through intelligent design recommendations and space optimization.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a testing ground for an agentic backend architecture for an AI Interior Design Agent. The project consists of a FastAPI backend for the AI agent logic and a basic Next.js frontend for visualizing results.

## General Approach

### **Agentic Architecture Philosophy**

- **Project-Based Workflow**: Each user interaction starts a new project with a unique UUID
- **Context Accumulation**: Projects accumulate context through user inputs and AI responses
- **Iterative Development**: Features are built incrementally, testing agentic patterns as we go
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Project context structure evolves based on actual usage patterns

### **Development Methodology**

- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Each feature is built completely before moving to the next
- **Documentation-First**: All functionality is documented as it's implemented
- **Testing Focus**: Prioritize testing architectural patterns over production-ready features
- **Incremental Refinement**: Context structure and project flow are refined through iteration

### **Technical Approach**

- **JSON File Storage**: Simple, file-based storage for rapid prototyping and testing
- **React Query Integration**: Consistent data fetching patterns throughout the frontend
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for API contracts and data structures
- **URL-Based State**: Project state is managed through URL parameters for shareability

## Architecture

### Backend

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Package Manager**: uv
- **Purpose**: AI agent logic, design recommendations, space analysis
- **Location**: `/backend/`

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Data Fetching**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **Purpose**: Basic interface to visualize and interact with AI recommendations
- **Location**: `/frontend/`

## Development Approach

- **Incremental Development**: Features will be added incrementally to test and refine the agentic architecture
- **Documentation**: All functionality will be documented as it's implemented
- **Step-by-Step Process**: Development follows a methodical, step-by-step approach
- **Testing Focus**: The repository prioritizes testing agentic backend patterns over production-ready features

## Frontend Guidelines

- **Data Fetching**: Use React Query (TanStack Query) exclusively for all API calls
- **UI Components**: Use Shadcn/ui components for consistent design and functionality
- **Component Architecture**: Break down large pages into smaller, reusable components
- **Direct Imports**: Use direct imports for components (no barrel exports)
- **No Raw Fetch**: Avoid using raw fetch requests in components - always use React Query hooks
- **Type Safety**: Maintain full TypeScript support for all API interactions

## Backend Guidelines

- **Structured Output**: Use Pydantic models with `responses.parse` for type-safe AI responses
- **Vision API**: Use `analyze_image_with_vision()` for image analysis with structured output
- **Model Selection**: Use GPT-5 constants (GPT_5, GPT_5_MINI, GPT_5_NANO) for consistency
- **Testing**: Use the CLI test script (`cli.py`) to validate structured output functionality

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run fastapi dev
```

### Testing Structured Output

```bash
cd backend
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Run the CLI test
uv run python cli.py
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
